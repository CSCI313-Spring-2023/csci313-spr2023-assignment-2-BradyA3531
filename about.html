        <p class="aboutme">I am a 20 year old full time student at NDSU studying computer science. I work part time as a line cook on the weekends
            at a very busy bar/restaurant. I am currently in the process of looking and applying for internships to help further my
            education. I aspire to become a software engineer / programmer or web development.
